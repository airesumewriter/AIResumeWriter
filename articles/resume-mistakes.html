      <h1>Top Resume Mistakes That Are Costing You Interviews</h1>
      <p><em>Published: July 6, 2025 | Author: AI Resume Writer Team</em></p>

      <p>Even a small mistake on your resume can be the difference between getting an interview or getting ghosted. Here are the top resume blunders and how to avoid them:</p>

      <h2>1. Spelling and Grammar Errors</h2>
      <p>These signal carelessness. Always proofread or use tools like Grammarly before submitting.</p>

      <h2>2. Generic Objectives</h2>
      <p>“Seeking a challenging role...” is outdated. Replace with a powerful summary tailored to the job.</p>

      <h2>3. Overusing Buzzwords</h2>
      <p>“Hardworking,” “team player,” “go-getter”—these lack impact. Show, don’t tell.</p>

      <h2>4. Listing Duties Instead of Achievements</h2>
      <p>Don’t just say what you did. Quantify your impact: “Increased sales by 30% in 6 months.”</p>

      <h2>5. Using the Same Resume for Every Job</h2>
      <p>Each job is unique. Tailor your resume with specific keywords and role-relevant experiences.</p>

      <h2>6. Cluttered Layout or Poor Formatting</h2>
      <p>Make your resume scannable. Use white space, bold headings, and bullet points effectively.</p>

      <h2>7. Including Irrelevant Experience</h2>
      <p>If it doesn’t relate to the job, it’s noise. Prioritize relevance over history.</p>

      <h2>8. Wrong Contact Information</h2>
      <p>Double-check your email and phone number. One typo can cost you an opportunity.</p>

      <h2>9. Using Unprofessional Email Addresses</h2>
      <p>Stick to variations of your name. Avoid handles like “partyanimal23@email.com.”</p>

      <h2>10. Not Using Keywords</h2>
      <p>Without the right keywords, your resume won’t pass ATS filters. Study the job ad closely.</p>

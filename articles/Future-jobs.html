      <h2>1. Healthcare Professionals</h2>

      <h2>2. AI & Data Specialists</h2>
      <p>Ironically, AI needs humans. Machine learning engineers, data scientists, and prompt engineers are hot jobs of the future.</p>

      <p>As tech advances, so do threats. Security analysts and ethical hackers are essential to protecting digital infrastructure.</p>

      <h2>4. Creative Professionals</h2>
      <p>Writers, designers, animators, and brand storytellers offer originality and emotion‚Äîskills AI still struggles with.</p>

      <h2>5. Skilled Trades</h2>
      <p>Electricians, plumbers, and mechanics require hands-on problem-solving and adaptability‚Äîareas where AI can‚Äôt fully replace humans.</p>

      <h2>6. Mental Health & Wellness Coaches</h2>
      <p>Emotional intelligence, trust, and personal connection are the cornerstones of these roles.</p>

      <h2>7. Educators & Trainers</h2>
      <p>Teachers who adapt to hybrid digital learning will remain vital. Human mentorship still matters.</p>

      <h2>8. Project Managers</h2>
      <p>Orchestrating teams, timelines, and clients requires flexibility and leadership that AI lacks.</p>

      <h2>9. Sustainability & Climate Experts</h2>
      <p>Green energy engineers, environmental scientists, and sustainability officers are essential as climate change becomes more urgent.</p>

      <h2>10. Sales & Business Development</h2>
      <p>Understanding clients, persuading, and negotiating‚Äîespecially in B2B‚Äîremains a very human skill.</p>
